    {
        question: "What's the difference between image compression and conversion?",
        answer: "Compression reduces file size while keeping the same format. Conversion changes the file format (e.g., PNG to WebP) and usually includes compression."
    },
    {
        question: "Is image compression safe for SEO?",
        answer: "Yes, compressed images improve page speed and Core Web Vitals, which are Google ranking factors. Smaller files load faster and improve rankings."
    },
    {
        question: "Will compressing images reduce quality?",
        answer: "Professional compression tools minimize quality loss. Most users can't detect differences when using appropriate settings."
    },
    {
        question: "How much can images typically be compressed?",
        answer: "Compression varies by format: PNG (60-90%), JPEG (40-90%), WebP (50-80%). Results depend on image complexity and compression settings."
    },
    {
        question: "Should I compress images before uploading to my website?",
        answer: "Yes, always compress images before uploading. This reduces bandwidth costs, improves page speed, and enhances user experience."
    },
    {
        question: "Do compressed images work on all devices?",
        answer: "Yes, compressed images maintain the same format and work on all devices. The compression only reduces file size, not compatibility."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I batch compress multiple images?",
        answer: "Yes, most professional compression tools support batch processing to compress multiple images simultaneously."
    }

export const generalConverterFAQs = [
    {
        question: "Why should I convert images to different formats?",
        answer: "Different formats offer different advantages. WebP is smaller, PNG supports transparency, and JPEG is universally compatible. Converting optimizes for your specific needs."
    },
    {
        question: "Does converting images reduce quality?",
        answer: "Quality depends on the target format and settings. Lossless formats (PNG, lossless WebP) maintain quality. Lossy formats (JPEG, lossy WebP) optimize filesize with minimal visible loss."
    },
    {
        question: "What's the best image format for websites?",
        answer: "WebP is best for modern websites (25-35% smaller with great quality). Use PNG for transparency on older browsers, JPEG for photos with universal compatibility."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I convert images without losing metadata?",
        answer: "Most converters can preserve essential metadata like color profiles. Some metadata (EXIF, location data) may be removed for privacy and file size."
    },
    {
        question: "Is WebP supported by all browsers?",
        answer: "WebP has 95%+ browser support, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari (since 2020). It's safe for modern websites."
    },
    {
        question: "Should I use PNG or JPEG for photos?",
        answer: "Use JPEG for photos. It's optimized for photographs with file sizes 50-80% smaller than PNG while maintaining excellent quality."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I convert images back to their original format?",
        answer: "Yes, but you can't recover quality lost in lossy compression. Always keep original files if you may need them later."
