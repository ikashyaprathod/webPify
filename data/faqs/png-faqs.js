        question: "Is PNG compression lossless?",
        answer: "Yes, PNG compression is lossless when using tools like pngquant. The visual quality remains identical while file size is reduced by 60-90%."
    },
    {
        question: "Does PNG compression reduce quality?",
        answer: "No, professional PNG compression maintains visual quality. Advanced algorithms remove unnecessary data without affecting how the image looks."
    },
    {
        question: "How much can PNG images be compressed?",
        answer: "PNG images can typically be compressed by 60-90% using professional tools like pngquant, depending on the image complexity and color palette."
    },
    {
        question: "Will compression affect PNG transparency?",
        answer: "No, PNG transparency is fully preserved during compression. Alpha channels remain intact while file size is reduced."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is my PNG not compressing further?",
        answer: "Your PNG may already be optimized, have few colors, or be very simple. Complex images with gradients compress more than flat graphics."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the best PNG compression tool?",
        answer: "Professional tools using pngquant or similar algorithms offer the best compression. Look for tools that maintain quality while reducing file size significantly."
    },
    {
        question: "Is PNG good for SEO?",
        answer: "Yes, optimized PNG files improve page speed and Core Web Vitals, which are ranking factors. Smaller file sizes lead to faster loading times."
    },
    {
        question: "Should I use PNG or WebP for websites?",
        answer: "WebP is generally better for web use (25-35% smaller), but PNG is still good for images requiring transparency on older browsers."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I compress PNG without losing quality?",
        answer: "Yes, lossless PNG compression maintains identical visual quality. Modern tools reduce file size without any visible degradation."
    },
    {
        question: "How does PNG compression work?",
        answer: "PNG compression removes unnecessary metadata, optimizes color palettes, and uses advanced algorithms like pngquant to reduce file size without quality loss."
    },
    {
        question: "Is PNG better than JPEG for photos?",
        answer: "No, JPEG is better for photos due to smaller file sizes. PNG is ideal for graphics, logos, and images requiring transparency."
    },
    {
        question: "Does PNG compression affect file metadata?",
        answer: "Compression typically removes unnecessary metadata to reduce file size. Important data like color profiles can be preserved if needed."
    },
    {
        question: "What is pngquant compression?",
        answer: "Pngquant is a professional PNG compression algorithm that converts images to indexed color format, achieving 60-80% file size reduction with minimal quality loss."
    },
    {
        question: "How to optimize PNG for web?",
        answer: "Use compression tools, remove unnecessary metadata, ensure appropriate dimensions, and consider converting to WebP for modern browsers."
    },
    {
        question: "Is PNG compression safe for print?",
        answer: "Yes, lossless PNG compression is safe for print. The image quality remains identical, only the file size is reduced."
    }
